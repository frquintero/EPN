Query: Why is there something rather than nothing?
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Philosophical and scientific accounts converge on a view that existence arises from a non‑absolute substrate rather than a literal nothing. Classical metaphysics posits a necessary immutable principle; existentialism flips to contingent being with a void of meaning; process philosophy sees a creative ground generating contingent occasions. Modern physics describes a pre‑existent quantum vacuum or spacetime‑less state that is unstable and can fluctuate into a universe, while thermodynamics supplies low‑entropy initial conditions but not the ultimate cause. Metaphysical grounding requires either a necessary base (a first cause or primitive grounding relation) or a re‑conceived void that functions as a minimal positive ground. A robust explanation thus combines a necessary grounding principle with a dynamic, quantum‑fluctuating substrate that yields contingent reality.
