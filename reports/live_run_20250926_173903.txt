Query: Why is there something than nothing
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Various philosophical and scientific approaches attempt to answer why there is something rather than nothing. Philosophically, the Principle of Sufficient Reason holds that every fact must have a reason, leading to arguments that the universe requires an ultimate explanation such as a necessary being or a self‑causing cause. Discussions of necessity versus contingency argue that either the universe (or a fundamental entity) is metaphysically necessary or, if contingent, must depend on a necessary ground. Classic cosmological arguments like the Kalam argument and the argument from contingency assert that a beginning or dependence implies a cause. Modal realism and possible‑worlds theory claim that a world in which nothing exists is not possible, making something inevitable. Ontological arguments posit a maximally great being (God) that exists necessarily, providing the ultimate reason for existence. Scientific perspectives point to quantum vacuum fluctuations, where “nothing” is unstable and can give rise to a universe, though philosophers debate whether this counts as a true explanation. Theological summaries emphasize that a divine, necessary creator offers a coherent grounding for existence. The principle of plenitude or multiverse hypotheses suggest that if all possible states exist, some universe with something must exist. Though these approaches differ—some appeal to metaphysical necessity, others to causal mechanisms or physical processes—they all aim to explain why something exists rather than absolute nothing.

Role: REFORMULATOR
Prompt:
Role: REFORMULATOR

Task: ROLE: REFORMULATOR. You are an epistemological reformulator specializing in bias elimination, epistemic contextualization, and narrative priming. Your task is to transform biased questions into neutral, epistemologically-grounded inquiries that seed a cohesive narrative arc. First step to find the truth is to formulate the right questions. Reformulate the given query

Inputs:
  Input[1]: Why is there something than nothing

Instructions: Neutralize biases and eliminate assumptions.
Keep scope clear and answerable.
Output MUST be a JSON object with exactly one field: {"reformulated_question": "<text>"}.
No prose before or after the JSON.
Keep the reformulated question under 40 words.

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
Required format: {"reformulated_question": "<text>"}

Raw Response:
{"reformulated_question":"What explanations are offered for the existence of something rather than nothing?"}

Parsed Response:
{"reformulated_question": "What explanations are offered for the existence of something rather than nothing?"}

Role: ELUCIDATOR
Prompt:
Role: ELUCIDATOR

Task: ROLE: ELUCIDATOR. You are an epistemological explorer. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive set of analytical tasks that, when executed by specialized LLM nodes within a collaborative network, will extract maximum understanding from the inquiry. Discover both obvious and hidden dimensions that need investigation

Inputs:
  Input[1]: What explanations are offered for the existence of something rather than nothing?

Instructions: Ensure tasks are clear, actionable, and non-overlapping.
Return valid JSON only.
Output MUST be a JSON object with exactly one field 'tasks'.
'tasks' MUST be a JSON array (no prose before/after).
Each array item MUST be a two-element array: ['task N', 'ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <concise task description>']
<ROLE_NAME> MUST be UPPERCASE with underscores only (e.g., ANALYZER, EXPLORER, CONTEXTUALIZER, RELATION_MAPPER, SYNTHESIZER).
The last item MUST be ['task X', 'ROLE: SYNTHESIZER. Synthesize the collected outputs into a coherent, well-grounded answer.']
Each task MUST be self-contained and executable by a single role when paired with the reformulated query.
Each task description MUST end with 'RESPONSE_JSON: {\"node_output_signal\": \"<text>\"}'.
Keep each task under 50 words.
Select at most 4 items in total (including the final SYNTHESIZER item).

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
Required format: {"tasks": [["task N", "ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <desc> ... RESPONSE_JSON: {...}"], ...]}
