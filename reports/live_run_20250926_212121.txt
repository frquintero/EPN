Query: what are mental models in cognitive science
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Mental models are internal, often tacit, representations that simulate, predict, and reason about real‑world systems. They capture causal relations, constraints, and functional dynamics while abstracting irrelevant details (representational fidelity) and can be updated with new information (dynamism). Their core functions are: (1) providing top‑down expectations that shape perception; (2) supplying an inferential framework for deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning; (3) enabling mental rehearsal of alternative strategies for problem solving; (4) projecting outcomes to support decision‑making; (5) facilitating explanation, communication, and learning by allowing “what‑if” simulations. Compared to related constructs, schemas are more static, category‑level knowledge structures; scripts encode typical event sequences; conceptual models are external, formal artifacts; and cognitive maps focus on spatial relations. Mental models sit atop these static structures, using them as building blocks, and are instantiated within cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT‑R, SOAR) that manage storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Thus, mental models serve as dynamic, causal simulations that integrate perception, memory, and executive processes, guiding complex cognition and informing the design of instructional, interface, and AI systems.
