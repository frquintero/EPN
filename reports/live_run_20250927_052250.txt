Query: Why is there something than nothing
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
The two passages together outline a comprehensive account of how humans grapple with the "something vs. nothing" dilemma and how explanatory frameworks for this struggle have evolved. Cognitive science identifies three interlocking components—mental models that default to agency and ontological existence, neural systems (DMN, salience network, TPJ) that generate abstract notions of nothingness and trigger agency detection, and epistemic processes (predictive coding, affective modulation, metacognitive monitoring) that bias perception toward "something" unless uncertainty is low and confidence high. Historically, explanatory systems moved from mythic-religious narratives that externalized meaning, through philosophical rationalism and early experimental psychology that internalized reasoning, to the cognitive revolution’s computational view and the current neuroscientific‑evolutionary integration that ties abstract meaning‑making to predictive brain mechanisms. Across all phases, the adaptive themes of meaning construction, agency enhancement, social cohesion, and tool development persist, now realized as precision psychiatry, neuro‑enhancement, and digital mental‑health interventions. The integrated view suggests that our default bias toward "something" is rooted in ancient agency‑detecting heuristics, while modern scientific frameworks provide the tools to consciously modulate this bias, allowing individuals and societies to tolerate uncertainty, entertain the possibility of "nothing," and construct flexible narratives that support resilience in the face of existential threats.
