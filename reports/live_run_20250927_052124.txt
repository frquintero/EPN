Query: Why is there something than nothing
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
The historical and interdisciplinary discussion frames the age‑old “something rather than nothing” question as a shifting problem of consciousness. Early metaphysics moved from Aristotle’s plenitude and Cartesian dualism to materialist accounts that treated consciousness as emergent from matter. Psychology first measured consciousness (Wundt, James) then behaviorism sidestepped inner states, before the cognitive revolution re‑introduced internal representations as computational processes that turn sensory “nothing” into mental “something.” Neuroscience added neural correlates and theories (Integrated Information, Global Workspace) that quantify how patterned activity yields conscious states, while predictive coding and deep‑learning models illustrate how hierarchical inference and self‑organized representations can arise from random or low‑entropy beginnings. Philosophically, the question probes ontology, phenomenology, epistemology and cosmology, asking how consciousness relates to being, knowledge and the universe. The synthesis emphasizes that each disciplinary shift—metaphysical, materialist, behavioral, computational, neural, and cosmological—re‑defines the problem from a pure existence query to a concrete inquiry into how neural and algorithmic processes instantiate meaningful, high‑entropy mental states from baseline activity.
