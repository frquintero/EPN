Query: what are mental models in cognitive science
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Mental models are internal, dynamic representations that capture the essential structure, causal relations, and processes of a system or situation, enabling individuals to simulate, predict, and reason about its behavior. Core characteristics include representational fidelity (abstracting relevant features while omitting irrelevant ones), dynamic simulation (running mental “what‑if” scenarios), causal‑relational structure, situatedness (context‑specific construction and use), and partiality (incomplete and revisable). They differ from schemas, which organize broader knowledge about categories, and scripts, which encode stereotyped event sequences; mental models draw on these structures but add mechanistic detail and the ability to manipulate variables. Across cognitive science, mental models support reasoning and problem solving, forward prediction and control, learning and knowledge transfer, decision making, and communication. Empirical paradigms—such as model‑construction tasks, prediction simulations, eye‑tracking, neuroimaging, and transfer/analogical reasoning studies—demonstrate that mental models engage frontoparietal networks for spatial and working‑memory processes, distinct from the medial‑temporal regions implicated in schema retrieval. Theoretical accounts (e.g., Johnson‑Laird’s Mental Model Theory, Predictive Coding, Bayesian brain, Newell & Simon’s problem‑space theory) converge on the view that mental models act as cognitive scaffolds that reduce computational load, provide a sandbox for hypothesis testing, and underpin adaptive behavior.
