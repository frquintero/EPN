Query: what are mental models in cognitive science
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Mental models are internal, often simplified representations that the mind constructs to capture the causal, functional, or structural aspects of the world. They serve as dynamic schemas that allow individuals to simulate, predict, and interpret events, thereby supporting perception, reasoning, problem‑solving, decision‑making, and learning. In perception, mental models act as top‑down frameworks that fill gaps in ambiguous sensory input and bias attention toward expected patterns. In reasoning, they enable the mental simulation of scenarios, hypothesis testing, and inference across deductive, inductive, and analogical tasks. During learning, they function as scaffolds that integrate new information with existing knowledge, facilitating conceptual change when discrepancies arise. By linking abstract concepts to concrete experiences, mental models bridge perception and action, interacting with related constructs such as schemas and frames to shape cognition and behavior.

Role: REFORMULATOR
Prompt:
Role: REFORMULATOR

Task: ROLE: REFORMULATOR. You are an epistemological reformulator specializing in bias elimination, epistemic contextualization, and narrative priming. Your task is to transform biased questions into neutral, epistemologically-grounded inquiries that seed a cohesive narrative arc. First step to find the truth is to formulate the right questions. Reformulate the given query

Inputs:
  Input[1]: what are mental models in cognitive science

Instructions: Neutralize biases and eliminate assumptions.
Keep scope clear and answerable.
Output MUST be a JSON object with exactly one field: {"reformulated_question": "<text>"}.
No prose before or after the JSON.
Keep the reformulated question under 40 words.

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
Required format: {"reformulated_question": "<text>"}

Raw Response:
{"reformulated_question":"What is the definition and role of mental models within the field of cognitive science?"}

Parsed Response:
{"reformulated_question": "What is the definition and role of mental models within the field of cognitive science?"}

Role: ELUCIDATOR
Prompt:
Role: ELUCIDATOR

Task: ROLE: ELUCIDATOR. You are an epistemological explorer. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive set of analytical tasks that, when executed by specialized LLM nodes within a collaborative network, will extract maximum understanding from the inquiry. Discover both obvious and hidden dimensions that need investigation

Inputs:
  Input[1]: What is the definition and role of mental models within the field of cognitive science?

Instructions: Ensure tasks are clear, actionable, and non-overlapping.
Return valid JSON only.
Output MUST be a JSON object with exactly one field 'tasks'.
'tasks' MUST be a JSON array (no prose before/after).
Each array item MUST be a two-element array: ['task N', 'ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <concise task description>']
<ROLE_NAME> MUST be UPPERCASE with underscores only (e.g., ANALYZER, EXPLORER, CONTEXTUALIZER, RELATION_MAPPER, SYNTHESIZER).
The last item MUST be ['task X', 'ROLE: SYNTHESIZER. Synthesize the collected outputs into a coherent, well-grounded answer.']
Each task MUST be self-contained and executable by a single role when paired with the reformulated query.
Each task description MUST end with 'RESPONSE_JSON: {\"node_output_signal\": \"<text>\"}'.
Keep each task under 50 words.
Select at most 4 items in total (including the final SYNTHESIZER item).

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
Required format: {"query_decomposition": [["label", "ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <desc>"], ...]}
