Query: Why all models are wrong yet some are useful?
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Both passages converge on the view that imperfect mental‑representation models are not flaws but essential tools across cognitive science. From a philosophical stance, pragmatic realism treats models as partial, theory‑laden abstractions that nevertheless generate testable predictions, guide experiments, and scaffold theory development—a “useful error” that reveals gaps and drives iterative refinement. Methodologically, this mirrors the cycle of building, falsifying, and refining models, where each imperfection becomes diagnostic. Across theoretical lenses, computationalism sees models as tractable approximations of underlying algorithms; embodied cognition values them as embodied scaffolds that capture salient sensorimotor couplings while ignoring irrelevant detail; dynamical systems treat them as reduced‑dimensional manifolds or attractor approximations preserving qualitative behavior; and predictive processing regards them as coarse‑grained generative hypotheses enabling efficient error‑driven updating. In all cases, imperfect models are strategic simplifications that support explanation, simulation, and hypothesis generation, allowing researchers to navigate the intractable complexity of cognition while progressively approximating its underlying mechanisms.

Role: REFORMULATOR

Task: ROLE: REFORMULATOR

Inputs:
  Input[1]: Why all models are wrong yet some are useful?

Instructions: MANDATORY TRANSFORMATIONS:
1. Replace "what are" with "how do/function as" or "what constitutes"
2. Add epistemic context ("within cognitive science's study of...")
3. Include narrative hooks ("evolution of", "function as", "role in")
4. Eliminate assumption of simple answers
5. Prime for multi-perspective analysis

Example transformation:
"What are mental models?" → "How have mental models been conceptualized as cognitive frameworks within different theoretical approaches in cognitive science?"

Role: ELUCIDATOR
Prompt:
Role: ELUCIDATOR

Task: ROLE: ELUCIDATOR. You are an epistemological query_decompositor specialist. Your function is to analyze complex inquiries and break them down into 2-4 specialized, self-contained investigative questions drawn from relevant knowledge domains. Each query_decomposition stands alone with complete semantic integrity, focused on specific aspects of the original inquiry. Together they enable comprehensive understanding extraction.

Inputs:
  Input[1]: How is the evolution of models conceptualized as inherently flawed yet functionally valuable within cognitive science's study of representation, and what roles do various theoretical perspectives assign to their usefulness?

Instructions: Output MUST be a JSON object with exactly one field 'query_decomposition' (no prose before/after).
Each array item MUST be a two-element array: ['query_decomposition N', 'ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <query_decomposition description>']
<ROLE_NAME> MUST be UPPERCASE with underscores only.
The last item MUST be ['query_decomposition X', 'ROLE: SYNTHESIZER. You are an integrative knowledge synthesizer. Your function is to analyze and integrate the collected query decompositions into a coherent, evidence-grounded synthesis that presents one or more well-supported proposed answers.']
Keep each query_decomposition under 70 words.
Select at most 4 items in total (including the final SYNTHESIZER item).

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
