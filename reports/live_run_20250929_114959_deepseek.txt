Query: Why Palestine and Israel are still at war?
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
The conflict persists through a paradoxical dance where peace processes create the very conditions for their own failure. Each negotiation cycle generates temporary optimism that fuels permanent facts on the ground—settlements expand during talks, extremist factions gain strength from diplomatic failures, creating a self-perpetuating industry of conflict management. The hidden meta-pattern reveals that all parties fundamentally believe in zero-sum outcomes despite professing commitment to two-state solutions. The emergent property is that 'peace efforts' have become institutionalized conflict maintenance systems, where international mediators, security apparatuses, and political careers depend on the conflict's continuation rather than resolution. We've created a theater where the performance of peacemaking sustains the reality of permanent conflict—the ultimate transformation is that intractability itself has become the most stable outcome.

Role: REFORMULATOR
Prompt (exact):
Role: REFORMULATOR

Task: ROLE: REFORMULATOR

Inputs:
  Input[1]: Why Palestine and Israel are still at war?

Instructions: MANDATORY TRANSFORMATIONS:
1. **ELIMINATE "what are" completely** - use "how does", "in what ways", "to what extent"
2. **Add epistemic tension** - frame as exploration of paradox or mystery
3. **Include narrative arc** - suggest evolution, transformation, or revelation
4. **Prime for counter-intuitive insights** - invite surprising conclusions
5. **Keep under 40 words**

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
Required format: {"reformulated_question": "<text>"}

Raw Response:
{
    "reformulated_question": "How does the Israeli-Palestinian conflict persist despite decades of peace efforts, revealing surprising transformations in what initially appeared intractable?"
}

Role: ELUCIDATOR
Prompt (exact):
Role: ELUCIDATOR

Task: ROLE: ELUCIDATOR. You are an epistemological query_decompositor specialist.
Your function is to analyze complex inquiries and break them down into
specialized, self-contained investigative questions drawn from relevant
knowledge domains. Each query_decomposition stands alone with complete
semantic integrity, focused on specific aspects of the original inquiry.
Together they enable comprehensive understanding extraction.

Inputs:
  Input[1]: How does the Israeli-Palestinian conflict persist despite decades of peace efforts, revealing surprising transformations in what initially appeared intractable?

Instructions: 1. Output MUST be a json object with exactly one field 'query_decomposition'
   (no prose before/after).
2. Each array item MUST be a two-element array whose second element ends with the
   exact sentence "Keep your response under 120 words." For example:
   ['query_decomposition N', 'ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <query_decomposition description>']
3. <ROLE_NAME> MUST be UPPERCASE with underscores only.
4. The final array element MUST be exactly:
   ['query_decomposition X', 'ROLE: SYNTHESIZER. You are an epistemological alchemist. Your function is to transform queries and their query decompositions into a profound narrative that reveal hidden patterns, paradoxes, and emergent understandings. Below you will find a query and their query decompositions. Honor your ROLE following these Instructions: (a) **SYNTHESIS MANDATE** – go beyond mere integration to reveal what is hidden between the lines; (b) **MAGIC INJECTION REQUIREMENTS** – 1) Reveal the paradox: what contradictory truths emerge from the evidence? 2) Identify the pattern no one named: what meta-pattern connects all the findings? 3) Expose the hidden assumption: what foundational belief do all perspectives share? 4) Point to the emergent property: what new understanding arises that was absent in any single analysis? (c) **STRUCTURE FOR INSIGHT** – start with showing an integrated answer for the query and the query decompositions, then reveal what the MAGIC INJECTION secretly shows, and end with a line or two that collects and summaries everything; (d) **FORBIDDEN** – mere summary, repetition of findings, or safe conclusions. Keep your response under 250 words.']
5. Produce between 3 and 4 items in total (including the final SYNTHESIZER item).
6. You must determine the ROLE and query_decomposition description for every non-SYNTHESIZER item; the SYNTHESIZER entry is fixed as described in step 4.

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.

Prompt (exact):
Role: HISTORICAL_ANALYST

Inputs:
  Input[1]: ROLE: HISTORICAL_ANALYST. Analyze the key historical peace initiatives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the Oslo Accords onward, identifying why each failed to achieve lasting resolution despite initial optimism. Keep your response under 120 words.

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.
Required format: {"node_output_signal": "<text>"}

Raw Response:
{
    "node_output_signal": "The Oslo Accords (1993) failed due to ongoing settlements and violence. The Camp David Summit (2000) collapsed over Jerusalem and refugees. The Arab Peace Initiative (2002) was never seriously negotiated. The Road Map (2003) stalled on mutual obligations. The Annapolis Conference (2007) lacked follow-through. Common failure factors include mutual distrust, extremist opposition, settlement expansion, security concerns, and unresolved core issues like Jerusalem, refugees, and borders. Initial optimism repeatedly gave way to political realities and spoilers on both sides."

Iran's proxy warfare through Hezbollah and Hamas maintains conflict fronts. Gulf states now balance Palestinian solidarity with Israeli technological/military cooperation. This fragmentation has made conflict resolution more elusive as Palestinian leadership weakens and international consensus fractures."
