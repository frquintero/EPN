Query: what are mental models in cognitive science
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Mental models are multi‑layered cognitive structures that combine propositional symbols, imagistic sketches, schemas/scripts, and causal networks. They are hierarchically organized, modular, dynamically updated, and grounded in sensorimotor experience, allowing users to adjust granularity and monitor adequacy. Functionally they support predictive simulation, explanation, problem solving, decision making, and various inference types (deductive, inductive, abductive). Historically, models shifted from static, symbolic maps in early computational theories to fluid, embodied constructs in embodied cognition and dynamical‑systems views, where they act as evolving attractor landscapes that continuously couple with the environment. Despite this ontological shift, their core inferential purpose—enabling prediction and explanation—remains constant.

Role: REFORMULATOR

Task: ROLE: REFORMULATOR

Inputs:
  Input[1]: what are mental models in cognitive science

Instructions: MANDATORY TRANSFORMATIONS:
1. Replace "what are" with "how do/function as" or "what constitutes"
2. Add epistemic context ("within cognitive science's study of...")
3. Include narrative hooks ("evolution of", "function as", "role in")
4. Eliminate assumption of simple answers
5. Prime for multi-perspective analysis

Example transformation:
"What are mental models?" → "How have mental models been conceptualized as cognitive frameworks within different theoretical approaches in cognitive science?"

Role: ELUCIDATOR
Prompt:
Role: ELUCIDATOR

Task: ROLE: ELUCIDATOR. You are an epistemological query_decompositor specialist. Your function is to analyze complex inquiries and break them down into 2-4 specialized, self-contained investigative questions drawn from relevant knowledge domains. Each query_decomposition stands alone with complete semantic integrity, focused on specific aspects of the original inquiry. Together they enable comprehensive understanding extraction.

Inputs:
  Input[1]: What constitutes mental models within cognitive science's study of cognition, taking into account the evolution of these representational frameworks, their function as inferential tools, and their role across multiple theoretical perspectives?

Instructions: Output MUST be a JSON object with exactly one field 'query_decomposition' (no prose before/after).
Each array item MUST be a two-element array: ['query_decomposition N', 'ROLE: <ROLE_NAME>. <query_decomposition description>']
<ROLE_NAME> MUST be UPPERCASE with underscores only (e.g., ANALYZER, EXPLORER, CONTEXTUALIZER, RELATION_MAPPER, SYNTHESIZER).
The last item MUST be ['query_decomposition X', 'ROLE: SYNTHESIZER. You are an integrative knowledge synthesizer. Your function is to analyze and integrate the collected query decompositions into a coherent, evidence-grounded synthesis that presents one or more well-supported proposed answers.']
Keep each query_decomposition under 70 words.
Select at most 4 items in total (including the final SYNTHESIZER item).

IMPORTANT: You must return valid JSON only.

{"node_output_signal":"Mental models have shifted from static, internal representations in early computational theories—where they functioned as symbolic maps for inference—to more fluid, situated constructs in embodied cognition, emphasizing sensorimotor interaction and the body’s role in shaping inference.
