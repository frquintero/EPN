Query: what are mental models in cognitive science
================================================================================

Final Synthesis:
Mental models are internal, often propositional or analogical representations that simulate possible states of affairs, enabling prediction, inference, and problem solving. Defined by Johnson‑Laird (1983) and expanded by Gentner & Stevens (2014), they integrate perceptual, linguistic, and experiential information and are grounded in sensorimotor systems (Barsalou, 2008; Norman, 2020). Functionally, they generate expectations about future events, derive unseen facts from known premises, and scaffold variable manipulation for action selection, with empirical support from behavioral tasks, neuroimaging (hippocampal‑prefrontal, lateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, dorsolateral prefrontal, basal‑ganglia), and computational modeling. Related constructs include schemas (stored knowledge templates), representations (symbolic or image‑based encodings), simulations (dynamic “what‑if” processes), cognitive maps (spatial mental models), and conceptual frameworks (higher‑level abstractions). These elements form a network where schemas feed into representations, which are used in simulations; outcomes update schemas and refine the mental model over time.

{"node_output_signal":"Mental models are internal, often propositional or analogical representations that individuals construct to simulate and reason about the world, allowing them to predict outcomes, infer unseen states, and guide action.

{"node_output_signal":"Mental models are internal representations that support three core cognitive functions. 1) Prediction: models generate expectations about future states, allowing individuals to simulate outcomes before they occur. Empirical work uses tasks like probabilistic forecasting, eye‑tracking of imagined scenarios, and neuroimaging of hippocampal‑prefrontal circuits during forward simulation. 2) Inference: models enable the derivation of unseen facts from known premises (deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning). Researchers test inference by presenting logical puzzles, measuring response times, and recording activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal areas. 3) Problem solving: models provide a scaffold for manipulating variables, testing alternatives, and selecting actions. Experimental paradigms such as the Tower of Hanoi, analogical transfer tasks, and virtual navigation assess how participants construct, update, and apply models; performance is linked to activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal‑ganglia loops. Across these functions, empirical investigation combines behavioral metrics (accuracy, latency), computational modeling (Bayesian or reinforcement‑learning frameworks), and neurophysiological methods (fMRI, EEG, lesion studies) to validate the role of mental models in cognition."}

Raw Response:
{"node_output_signal":"The mental model construct is linked to several related cognitive representations: • Schemas: stored knowledge structures that provide the organized patterns of information which mental models draw upon to generate expectations and interpret new data. • Representations: internal symbolic or analog formats (e.g., propositional, image‑based) that encode the content of a mental model, allowing it to be manipulated in thought. • Simulations: dynamic processes that use the model’s representations to run “what‑if” scenarios, supporting prediction and problem solving. • Cognitive Maps: spatially organized mental models that integrate relational information about environments, often overlapping with schemas for navigation. • Conceptual Frameworks: higher‑level, abstract mental models that organize multiple schemas and representations into coherent theoretical structures. The relationships can be visualized as a network: mental models sit at the center, receiving input from schemas (as stored templates), encoding that input into representations (symbolic or analog), and feeding those representations into simulation mechanisms for inference. In turn, the outcomes of simulations can update schemas (learning) and reshape representations, creating a feedback loop that refines the mental model over time."}
